# SEC---FOLDER
Add some privacy and security to your folders
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, you are using the latest version of sec-folder
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With sec-folder, you can add a password for any folder. :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you only have to choose what suits you from the options by writing
the number next to the option, then enter the folder path
that you want to encrypt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Note: the tool can only encrypt the folders in windows os, but in V2 we work to improve the tool. 
--Note: If you lose the password or the path of the folder, it is almost impossible to recover the contents of the folder,
 so we recommend that you memorize the password and the path well.
